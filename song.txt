Bang goes, the stradivarius
Jail clothes, paint the experience
Phantoms, can’t they abandon us?
Who knows, I suppose, echoes through the phones
Up in the air and over the wall
Seems that’s unfair. Are you numb to it all?
Won't you pick up the phone for me?
Could you answer me? Honestly…

[Pre-Chorus]
Let’s keep it on track, hi-hat
Flowin’, keep the rhythm going. Contact!
It’s a fact, make your love open
It’s your own camp, that’s that
Hoping that nobody’s gonna ruin that
Nobody's gonna ruin that for ya
